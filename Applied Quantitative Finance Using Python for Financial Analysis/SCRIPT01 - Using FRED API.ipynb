The Gross Domestic Product can be measured through different approaches but the most useful is the expenditure approach. The expenditure approach is based on the following formula:\n",

The theory is based that the households offer funds to the banks as savings or to the companies as investments. Households also offer labor to the companies in returns of funds, salaries, that can be used for consuming the products created by the companies or they can be invested and/or saved. Also, from the salary, the government charges taxes which are used for public goods and services. Finally, exports and imports are based on the exposure of a country to other economies. In this sense, if a country didn´t share economic activity with other countries there wouldn´t exist exports and imports, just consumption, investment and government expenditure.\n",
